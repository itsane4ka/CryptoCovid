  Mankind will remember 2020 for a long time. COVID-19â€¦ The global pandemic, lockdown, has already killed more than five million people worldwide and the virus has not yet receded. Even now, each of us is threatened by new waves of spread, mutations of the disease.
  Thousands of PCR tests are performed every day in all regions of Ukraine. Also, according to the Law on Personal Data Protection, the results of analyzes are personal information, so it is very important that it is impossible to steal or lose this confidential information. By the way, the same applies not only to covid, but also, for example, cancer.
  In our country, this industry needs rapid modernization, because Exel or a notebook database does not use any security tools. So the idea was to create a CryptoCovid application to encrypt / decrypt large amounts of information.
  
  The aim of the work was to create an easy-to-use program for medical laboratory staff, which would reliably protect the personal information of customers.
